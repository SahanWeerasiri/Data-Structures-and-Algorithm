## Introduction

This repository is designed to help you learn and practice data structures and algorithms in C++. It includes a collection of lab exercises that cover a wide range of topics, from basic data structures to advanced algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed a C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.).
- You have a basic understanding of C++ programming.

## Installation

To clone this repository, run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SahanWeerasiri/Data-Structures-and-Algorithm.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory:

```sh
cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithm
```

## Usage

Each lab exercise is located in its respective directory. To compile and run a specific lab exercise, navigate to its directory and use the following commands:

```sh
g++ -o output_file_name source_file.cpp
./output_file_name
```

Replace `output_file_name` with the desired name for the compiled executable and `source_file.cpp` with the name of the source file.
